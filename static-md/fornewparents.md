title: Why babywear as new parents?
----

First of all, congratulations! You've just become parents, which is a most amazing thing. But it is also an exhausting thing, an overwhelming thing, and a thing that never seems to end. And it is wonderful, beautiful and extra-ordinary. So, where does babywearing come in? And why would you do it? Won't I spoil my child? Won't it be too tiring for me?

In short, wearing your baby can be a sanity saving tool. It can help you have your hands free as your  baby finally sleeps and you can read a book or make yourself a sandwich. It can help you get out of your 3rd floor apartment that doesn't have an elevator. It can help you get somewhere easier without a drivers license. It can help you bond with your baby easier. It can help you feel surer about yourself as a new parent. It can help father bond with his baby.
With a little bit of practice you can make babywearing make your experience of the baby/toddler years a little less stressful, a little less hectic, and maybe a little bit more relaxed and fun.
