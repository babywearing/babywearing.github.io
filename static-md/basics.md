# Sling types

Stretchy Wrap - this type of wrap is made out of a thick t-shirt like material. Some wraps have stretch both ways, some only one way. Many mums/dads prefer to start with a stretchy, because it can be pre-tied and is said to be easier. I personally have not started with a stretchy, as I don't find them very easy ( stretchy wraps really need to be tighted properly because otherwise they are quite uncomfortable and sometimes even unsafe to wear) and you cannot use them after your baby reaches 9 kilo's. There also exists a hybrid stretchy, the caboo, which has rings to make tying it easier. You can only tie it in one way, so they are quite limited, but are easier to put on than a normal stretchy. They are very snuggly in winter, but can be too hot in the summer.

Woven wrap - this type of wrap is woven in a special way so that it has an ever so slightly diagonal stretch in it. This makes tying it easier than a tablecloth, and makes a snug carry easier to achieve. They are incredibly versatile ( see our gallery), relatively cheap, and there exists a mind boggling amount of choice. You can buy one - and use it for the next 4 years of babywearing, or you They can spent a fortune and have heaps, or somewhere in the middle - just enough to wrap you through all the seasons and all the different stages of the first years of childhood. They can be quite daunting, and it is wise to take the first steps with a guide! All out, my favorite type of slings!

Mei-tai - this type of carrier is made out of sturdy fabric, sometimes wrap fabric. It is basically a square with 4 long strips at each corner. They are easier to put on than a woven wrap, and are a little bit cooler. They are pretty versatile, and might be a good first step into back carrying. Because they are easy to master, I find it a good choice for grandparents and other caregivers, who are not familiar with babywearing. Because they are tied with two knots, they can fit anyone easily, and do not need any readjustments.

Half buckle - these are usually made out of wrap fabric, and are very much like a mei tai. The waist band closes with a buckle, which needs to be readjusted it a larger/smaller person wants to wear it. The shoulder straps are loose, and need to be tied ( which makes for a little bit less adjusting). Great for if you want something quick, and if others in your household want to wear the baby as well, but they have similar waists to you.

Full buckle - these carriers can be daunting at first because of the readjustments that you need to make the first time. If you don't take the time for this, you might find the carrier uncomforatble. It is not easy to swap from one person to the other, and I see that quite a lot of people simply have 2: one for mum, one for dad. Some people really like them, I don't. They are not very versatile, and your child can outgrow them. Usually you cannot use them from new born onwards.

Ring Sling - this is basically a small woven wrap with rings on one end. Once you have mastered the skill of tightening it correctly, it is by far the fastest sling to pop your child in and out of! (breast) feeding in it is also relatively easy and safe to accomplish.
