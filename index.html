  	<p>Hi! I'm Tama, and I like to help people with computer problems. Whether you need help writing your CV, can't figure out how email works, or have a computer that's slowed down or isn't doing what you want it to, I'm happy to help. I can explain anything from email and text editing to cryptography and operating systems.</p>
  	<p>Come on in with your computer and let me know how I can help; The first twenty minutes are free - if I'm still busy at that point I'll give you an estimate.</p>

		<p>I'm situated at 77 Gillies street, between the FourSquare and the Ambulance station, on the main road in Kawakawa. It overlooks the railway station and the gas station, and there's plenty of free parking in front. So come in and have a chat!</p>
